# Google Photos Slideshow

## Setup

You'll need a google API client ID to use with Google Photos. Create `js/config/config.json` with contents:

```
{
  "googlePhotosClientID": "<Your Client ID>"
}
```

then:

`npm i`
`npm start`

You'll need to login to your google account, then the album choice UI is very basic, choose an album and it will load the photos into
a slide show.
